<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>What is NumPy?</h2>
<p>
<b>NumPy </b>is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains various features including these important ones:

A powerful N-dimensional array object
Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
Arbitrary data-types can be defined using Numpy which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.</p>

<ul><li>NumPy is a Python library that is the core library for scientific computing in Python.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>MIt contains a collection of tools and techniques that can be used to solve on a computer mathematical models of problems in Science and Engineering. One of these tools is a high-performance multidimensional array object that is a powerful data structure for efficient computation of arrays and matrices..</li></ul>
<ul><li>
The same approach is taken for almost every library in python when we want to use it. We either import the entire library or just the part we want to use.</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>An array is a collection of elements of the same data type. 
You should know that, on a structural level, an array is basically nothing but pointers. Itâ€™s a combination of a memory address, a data type, a shape and strides.. </li></ul>

<ul><li>
We can't have a number and string(text) in the same array. It's either all numbers, all strings or other data types that we can use to build arrays. 
An array with one row and one column is a one dimensional array..</li></ul>

<ul><li>We use the convention np.array() to craft an array. 
The word axis is singular and axes is plural. 
The most common array we are going to have is an array of numbers.  </li> </ul>
