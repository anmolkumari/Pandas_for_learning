
# The plot.hist() method takes in multiple arguments. Letâ€™s look at a few important ones below:

# The first argument is the data set which is to be plotted
# Following are the optional arguments which may or may not be given:

# bins: This defines the number of intervals in the histogram

# range: This defines the range within which the number of bins should exist

# align: This takes in three possible values; left, mid, right and decides the position of the histogram in the image

# log: Set to true, this will return the log values of the scale for the histogram
